MrBeast YouTube Channel Analysis 📊🎥

This project analyzes MrBeast's YouTube videos using the YouTube API and various Python libraries. It gathers data such as video transcriptions, metrics, sentiment analysis, word counts, and more, to provide insights into the content and popularity of his videos.

Technologies and Libraries Used 🛠️
This project utilizes several Python libraries and tools to interact with YouTube, process data, and generate visualizations:

File Management and Environment Variables 🌐
google.colab: Enables uploading and downloading files within Google Colab.

dotenv: Loads environment variables from .env files (e.g., API keys).

os: Interacts with the operating system to handle paths and variables.

Interacting with YouTube API 🎬
googleapiclient.discovery: Connects with the YouTube API to fetch video details, comments, and more.

youtube_transcript_api: Retrieves YouTube video transcriptions.

Data Management 📊
pandas: Handles tabular data (DataFrames) for analysis.

json: Works with JSON data (key-value pairs).

requests: Makes HTTP requests to APIs.

Image and Video Processing 🖼️📹
PIL: Manipulates images (open, edit, convert).

numpy: Handles arrays and numerical operations.

cv2: Image and video processing (e.g., face detection).

io.BytesIO: Converts binary data into manageable objects.

Sentiment Analysis and Text Processing 🧠💬
nltk: Natural Language Processing library.

SentimentIntensityAnalyzer: Performs sentiment analysis on text (positive, negative, or neutral).

stopwords: Filters out common words (stopwords) that don’t contribute to text analysis.

NoSQL Database (MongoDB) 💾
pymongo: Connects and manages NoSQL databases in MongoDB Atlas.

certifi: Verifies SSL certificates when connecting to MongoDB.

Data Visualization 📈
seaborn & matplotlib: Used for creating statistical graphs and custom visualizations.

plotly: Creates interactive, advanced visualizations.

wordcloud: Generates word clouds from text.

Text Analysis 🔠
sklearn.feature_extraction.text: Converts text into numerical vectors for text analysis.

Transcription Management 📝
tqdm: Displays a progress bar during long tasks.

concurrent.futures: Executes functions in parallel to improve performance.
